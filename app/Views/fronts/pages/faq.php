                                <p>There are various reasons why so many parents decide to enrol their children in a Montessori school. Montessori education places a focus on each child's unique needs and interests. As contrast to being pressured to achieve predetermined benchmarks or standards, the curriculum is created to let kids explore and learn at their own pace. Children are encouraged to follow their interests and take charge of their education, which fosters independence and self-motivation. In this article, we investigate why parents choose Montessori education for their children.</p>

                                <p>Within the field of education, the Montessori method is a tried-and-true strategy that places a strong emphasis on a child's overall development. These ideas, which were created by Dr. Maria Montessori in the early 20th century, are now well-known around the world for their distinctive and successful method of teaching.</p>
                                <p>Montessori's emphasis on independence, personalised learning, and fostering a love of lifelong learning has had a profound impact on early childhood education. Let's examine the fundamental ideas that underpin the Montessori approach. </p>

                                <p>active Play: Children have more opportunity for physical activity like running, jumping, and outside play when they spend less time in front of screens. This encourages the growth of coordination, muscle power, and motor skills.</p>
                                <p>Reducing screen time helps avoid a sedentary lifestyle, which lowers the risk of childhood obesity.

                                <p>Increased Attention Span: Too much screen time might make it difficult for kids to focus and concentrate. Limiting screen time encourages kids to do things that need their undivided attention.</p>
                                <p>Better Problem-Solving Skills: Playing with toys, solving puzzles, and building with blocks all encourage cognitive growth and problem-solving abilities.</p>
