                    <p class="dc-para">The Comprehensive Montessori Course – Post Graduate Diploma Level Introduction Even though Maria Montessori belonged to an era gone by (1870-1952), her principles are still prevalent in the present education system. The relevance of Maria Montessori’s philosophy cannot be denied in our current thinking, understanding and responses to teaching the young learners. She was indeed an unique individual- and maybe if she belonged to this era, the news media would have labelled her as someone who has the ability to think out of the box. A pioneer in enabling children learn through meaningful experience, she is an inspiration worldwide to what is popularly known as the “Montessori schools”. The course takes a comprehensive view at the Montessori Method and philosophy with an overview of its relevance and application in today’s cyber age. The course takes an overall view of the philosophy and methodologies related to early childhood education world-wide and touches upon the psychology related to early childhood, before discussing in details the various aspects of the Montessori Method.</p>
